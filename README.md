# 👋 Hi, I'm Adam LaCasse

**Senior Software Engineer · CS Grad Student · Relentless Music Nerd**

I build enterprise-scale web applications (Node.js, React, Java/Spring Boot, Python) and cloud-native services on AWS.  
I’m also working toward my **Master of Science in Computer Science**, digging deeply into algorithms, discrete math, data modeling, and the theory that strengthens real-world engineering.

Outside of code, I’m a lifelong music obsessive — the kind of person who can just as easily talk about Jack DeJohnette’s fusion period as the production quirks in Talking Heads’ _Little Creatures_.  
I love blending that curiosity with technology, whether through side projects, metadata exploration, or building tools like **Freq Show** for fellow music geeks.
